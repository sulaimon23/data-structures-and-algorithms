### Running the Code

Each file is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
# Run any file to see examples and test cases
node data-structures/01-arrays.js
node algorithms/01-sorting.js
node practice-problems/problems.js
```

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Time Complexity
- **O(1)**: Constant time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic
- **O(n)**: Linear
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic
- **O(2ⁿ)**: Exponential

### Space Complexity
- **Auxiliary Space**: Extra space used
